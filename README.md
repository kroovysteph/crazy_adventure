To successfully compile the game you need to unzip the assignment_challenge.zip.
In there you'll find a directory called "crazy_adventure".
This directory needs to be in the same working directory
as the "prog1lib" library. If you're unable to compile the game this is the
reason. Make sure your "prog1lib/lib" is compiled aswell!
Have fun!
